#spboot-chassi

# Discalimer
This project was and is being developed in my free time. This means I'll do my 
best to solve any issues, but a few issues are to be expected. This also means there
is a lot to be done, and a lot that could be better. That being said, 
this is currently in use in a handful of professional microservices without 
any issues. I'll continue to use it as it evolves, and I don't expect any 
downsides to it. Be it as it may, a test suite is needed. Until a comprehensive 
set of tests is written, this project's version will be labeled as less than 1.0.0.

#What is this project?
This is an implementation of a microservice's chassis pattern for spring boot 
applications. It deals with a few common distributed (or not sou distributed) 
applications concerns:

- Logging
- Metrics and monitoring
- Stamp coupling
- Data validation
- Data transformation
