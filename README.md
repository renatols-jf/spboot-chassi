# spboot-chassi

# Discalimer
This project was and is being developed in my free time. This means I'll do my 
best to solve any issues, but a few issues are to be expected. This also means there
is a lot to be done, and a lot that could be better. That being said, 
this is currently in use in a handful of professional microservices without 
any issues. I'll continue to use it as it evolves, and I don't expect any 
downsides to it. Be it as it may, a test suite is needed. Until a comprehensive 
set of tests is written, this project's version will be labeled as less than 1.0.0.

Also, this project does not currently support NIO as it uses ThreadLocal to control
the request context. A simple solution is to add methods to take a snapshot of
the context and reinitialize after the NIO code. A more automatic solution would
require greater effort. Be it as it may, the snapshot is also not supported yet.

# What is this project?
This is an implementation of a microservice's chassis pattern for spring boot 
applications. It deals with a few common concerns for distributed 
(or not so distributed) applications:

- Logging
- Metrics and monitoring
- Stamp coupling
- Data validation
- Data transformation

# Motivation
I created this project based on the experiences I had while developing microservices
in the last couple of years or so, and also based on the reading I've done so far.
It's not uncommon for application needs to be ignored in favor of domain behavior, 
and the little code that exists is generally duplicated in many places. Also, I have
seen my fair share of anemic models, and while I understand it's never so simple to
get rid of data holders, I strive to use them the least possible.

The whole framework is based on the idea that all that happens within an application
request is connected to its current context. Data validation is not static, and 
neither is data transformation. The current context is available to the application 
anytime and can be used to transform and validate data, among other things.

# Usage
This is a Spring Boot framework, and it will need to access Spring-managed
objects and dependency injection. A new interaction mechanism will be provided in
future releases, but currently, this project's main package needs to be scanned by
Spring. This is done by adding the `ComponentScan` annotation to the application, 
as in:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan("io.github.renatolsjf")
public class DemoApplication {
```

`@SpringBootApplication` adds `@ComponentScan` for the application's main package,
but I've seen issues with this when adding another package. 
So you might need to add it again, as in:

```
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan("com.example.demo")
@ComponentScan("io.github.renatolsjf")
public class DemoApplication {
```

## Request
[Request](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/request/Request.java) 
is a unit of behavior. Everything that happens in the application should be
within a request. It automatically provides a means to log the request, update application
metrics, and some other useful application behavior. The idea is to think of a request
as a unit of processing, no matter the entry point. An HTTPS call should be mapped to
a request, just as a message consumed from a queue.

Request is an abstract class and needs to be extended to provide any functionality.
The idea is for the superclass to control application behavior, while the subclass
controls domain behavior.

There are a few constructors available, but we will approach only the most complete:

```
public Request(String operation, String transactionId, String correlationId, List<String> projection,
                   Map<String, String> requestContextEntries)
```

### operation
Operation is the name given to the request or unit of behavior. While we might
have some more generic request implementations, it is expected that the subclass
initializes this value without it actually being one of its constructor parameters:

```
public CalculateMarginRequest(String transactionId, String correlationId, List<String> projection,
                   Map<String, String> requestContextEntries) extends Request {
    super("CALCULATE_MARGIN", transactionId, correlationId, projection, requestContextEntries);                  
}
```

This operation name will be the same used elsewhere to assert validations and
transformations, so it's probably a good idea to use a constant.

### transactionId
A unique identifier given to the transaction. The idea is to serve as an identifier
so a transaction can be traced through the various services. If a null 
transactionId is provided, a UUID4 will be created.

### correlationId
An external identifier given by an application outside the scope of 
the internal services. It enables the identification of every transaction or request
served with that corelationId.

### projection
Projection exists as a means to tackle stamp coupling. There are services that generate
big payloads as a response, and clients that need only a specific portion of that
response. This could lead to traffic overcharges, the need to map unnecessary fields,
among other issues.

Each request supports a list of field names that will be automatically filtered
before the response is given. Nestesd fields are represented with dots. 
So, if a request returns the following json:

```
{
   "aField":"aValue",
   "anotherField":true,
   "anObject":{
      "f1":12,
      "f2":null
   },
   "aList":[
      {
         "f3":false,
         "f4":"Andrew"
      },
      {
         "f3":true,
         "f4":"Ryan"
      }
   ]
}
```

the projection `["aField", "anObject.f2", "aList.f3"]` will yield: 

```
{
   "aField":"aValue",
   "anObject":{
      "f2":null
   },
   "aList":[
      {
         "f3":false
      },
      {
         "f3":true
      }
   ]
}
```

### requestContextEntries
We might want to log information that is not available to the current
service, but is used to identify messages in the service chain. Initializing this
map will make every entry* in it be logged with each message during the request
duration.

*Entries are logged in their own fields; exportation of fields other than message
depends on the logging configuration.

## Context
[Context](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/Context.java)
is the source of information for the current processing/request. It stores 
information like the operation in execution and the transactionId. It is
used by the framework to initiate transformations and validations. It also stores
information like elapsed time by type, which will be treated later in this
document.

It is initialized automatically as soon as a request object is created and
it's detroyed as soon as a request finishes. A context can be obtained
anywhere calling `Context.forRequest`
As a rule of thumb, we don't want to initialize the context manually elsewhere, 
so calling `Context.initialize` outside of a request will result in an error.
You also cannot call it manually inside a request, as it will result in an error
since the context already exists.

If you absolutely need to create a context outside of a request, the class in which
you will be doing so needs to be annotated with 
[@ContextCreator](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/ContextCreator.java).
This will enable a context to be created. If a context already exists, an error will
still be thrown.

##Logging
Logging can be done by requesting an 
[ApplicationLogger](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/ApplicationLogger.java)
from the context: `ApplicationLogger logger = Context.forRequest().createLogger()`.
With an ApplicationLogger instance, you can use the default logging levels to log
information, as is: `logger.info(message, param1, param2).log()`. A few observations
are in order:

- Any log level provides two arguments: a message and an object varargs. Any varargs
  present will replace `{}` inside the message. 
  `logger.info("{} is greater than {}", number2, number1).log` 
  will result in "2 is greater than 1" being logged.
  
- `ApplicationLogger#error` also provides an exception argument. This will result
  in the stack trace being logged. Currently, framework exceptions are logged
  with their stack traces. A future release will allow this to be disabled.
  
- The logging level methods do not actually log the information but rather wait
  for the `log()` call. That is because we might want to add some extra information
  to the log. Besides the fields present in the context, information related only
  to that message can also be logged:
    - `Context.forRequest().createLogger().log(message).attach("name", "Andrew").log()`
      will create a new field named "name" only for this message.
    - `Context.forRequest().createLogger().log(message).attachMap(aMap).log()`
      will create as many new fields as keys available in the map. This method
      also supports a String varargs to log only the desired fields.
    - `Context.forRequest().createLogger().log(message).attachObject(anObject).log()`
      will create as many fields as are available in the object. Again, you
      could filter the object providing only the keys you desire to log, but
      there is another approach for objects. You can annotate any field in a
      Class that you don't want to log as 
      [@Classified](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/data/Classified.java).
      This will create automatic transformations that will be applied to the field
      before exportation. You need to provide a 
      [ClassifiedCypher](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/data/cypher/ClassifiedCypher.java)
      implementation to the annotation. This strategy is used by the request as it logs
      its information. You can create yours or use one of the available:
        1. [HiddenClassifiedCypher](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/data/cypher/HiddenClassifiedCypher.java)
          which will print only if the field has a value or not.
        2. [IgnoringCypher](https://github.com/renatols-jf/spboot-chassi/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/renatolsjf/chassi/context/data/cypher/IgnoringCypher.java) 
          which will completely ignore that field.
